            "summary": "Hi. I'm Peter. I spent many years working for large firms of Chartered Accountants before getting a dog called Ace and realising life was too short to spend it all commuting and staring at a computer screen for the next 30 years.\n\nSo, we built Blue Penguin on the premise that we wanted to work closely with a smaller number of clients, rather than take on any client with a pulse and a year-end. This way, we can react to your needs much quicker than your average high street firm.\n\nYes, we do accounts and yes, we do tax returns. But enough about us – what are you after?\n\nWe really love finding out your aspirations and making sure we help you meet – end exceed – them.\n\nFor some clients, the bank balance and the Maserati are the aim. For others, it’s about being financially secure whilst never missing a school run or Sunday morning football. We’ll support ours with either (or both, if we can!). \n\nThe point is – our ideal client is a person first, and a business owner second.\n\nAnd, as you’ll see from our website and our Facebook pages, we don’t take ourselves too seriously. Despite being Chartered Accountants, the tie only comes out for weddings and funerals.\n\nWe’re open really late because a lot of our clients are very busy in the day, and like to chat once the kids have gone to bed. So go on, call us and see. Or, if you’d like a book a slot at your convenience please see www.calendly.com/blue-penguin\n\nTel: 01823 335262\nMob/WhatsApp: 07917 336533\nFax: Really??",

I have always enjoyed numbers but accountancy is so much more it is PUZZLE solving and HELPING PEOPLE.\n\nI quickly found that my favourite part of the job was dealing with clients, learning about and helping them. This could involve helping them run their business or accounting records, helping with tax planning or just offering a friendly face for them to deal with. The aim was to be more than JUST an accountant but to actually help clients.\n\nI progressed further to complete both the AAT and ACCA professional qualifications which means that I am now a certified accountant.\nI am also a certified advisor on both Xero and QuickBooks bookkeeping software as well as being a fluent user in SAGE Line 50. Further to this I spent three years teaching, part time, accountancy in a local college and feel that this allows me to more easily communicate with clients.\n\nMy motto when setting up my business is that the customer always gets the same level of great service no matter how big or small and I always pride myself on my ability to know everything about the clients that I am responsible for and recognise them easily on the street!\n\nIf you are looking for an accountant who cares you've come to the right place.",

At ACG it is not just about working with numbers, but with experienced professionals that are concerned about your business and its future.\n\nWe believe that we are far from your typical accountant. Our focus is on approachability, as well as ensuring total peace of mind whilst delivering high standards. There will be very few questions we haven’t been asked before and none that we can’t answer. All advice is given in easy to understand, plain speak, with no accountancy jargon. Our aim is to provide an excellent, friendly service whilst saving our clients money and leaving them to concentrate on their business. It’s about making your life easier!\n\nOur initial consultation is free of charge. Fees are then fixed to avoid any unwelcome surprises. Whilst it is a common perception that preparing and submitting accounts or financial information will be stressful and expensive, at ACG this is not the case. There is also the option to ease your financial burden and to spread the cost of your annual fee across the current financial year.

I have also served on the board of a medium sized signage company as their Finance Director for 16 years, then for a further 5 years as the Financial Controller when it became part of a group.  This gave me not only experience in bookkeeping, accounting and management reporting but also in the day to day running of a business. An insight that can only come from being closely involved with the day to day ups and downs of being in business.  This is the kind of expertise that my clients have found to be invaluable.\n\nI offer a service that guarantees that I am the person who will speak to you when you have issues to resolve, or questions on moving your business forward.  You will not have to wait to speak to me directly, and if you leave me a message I will reply within the day.",

This enables me to understand their perspective much more fully than I would have done before becoming a business owner. \n\nI offer a fully rounded service to support business owners in all aspects of the financial affairs of their business throughout its lifecycle from start up and early growth through to eventual sale. I try to bring a human touch with my professional knowledge and experience, minimising use of the jargon of accounting wherever possible and talking with my clients in plain English, which they tend to appreciate more. I aim to be a business advisor and partner for my clients as well as a good accountant. \n\nWe are fully MTD compliant and keen to help with this challenge and the many others which business owners face in their journey to grow and develop their businesses. \n\nRecently we have adopted Receipt Bank for capturing business documents, storing them and passing data through into Quickbooks.

          "summary": "I left school at 16 to become a trainee accountant at a Chartered Accountants in Blackpool. This was a long time ago now, before computers, everything was done manually and had to balance to the penny and Balance Sheets were still horizontal.  As frustratingly strict as this was, it was amazing grounding on discipline and fundamental concepts of accounting. Years later I have spent much time working in industry and enjoyed the diversity of consulting. There are not many industries I haven't come across.  I try to use my experience to help smaller business's and start-ups make the most of their opportunity's and encourage my clients to understand the importance of financial information and how it can help you establish and grow a successful business.\n\nI have spent several years working for charities and now use this expertise as an Independent Charity Examiner. I offer support to charity start ups and offer many free services to charities where ever I can. \n\nMy practice has a small office in Todmorden and is open most days and evenings, many of my clients don't have time to deal with their accounts in the daytime so evening meetings and calls are essential to keep up to date with things.\n\nI offer several accounting packages but prefer to advise on using quickbooks as the flexibility and customer support is excellent. I also find other packages seem that seem cheaper at the outset have many essential add-ons which you don't find out about till later, this is a pricing policy that I do not like to support.\n\nI offer fixed price services so my clients can plan and don't get unexpected bills at the end of the year.\n\nIf you need help and would like to chat about your situation please give me a call for some free advice. I guarantee I will do my best to help you, if I can't I will find someone that can. I have links with pensions advisors and complex tax advisors. I always offer a friendly service - no pin stripe suits in my office and children and dogs are very welcome.",

If so, then read on…\n\nWe don’t do jargon, we are the accountants that will tell you exactly how your business is performing.  We used to call ourselves the problem-solving accountants, but this sounded a little like we’d spent too much time drinking lattes with a marketing agency. That’s not us. \n\nWe won't judge you on the state of your business, but we have 4 key commitments to all our clients working with us:\nWe will get you back in control of your finances within 3 months\nWe will eradicate almost all of your paper receipts and invoices (never miss claiming some VAT again.)\nYou’ll always know if you can afford to bring on new people, machinery or premises (and we’ll help to create a plan to make it happen at the right time.)\nWe’ll turn around your work promptly, and always let you know when we plan to complete it. (One of our core values is ‘get stuff done’.)\n\nI may now be a little soft in my early 40s (that’s becoming a family man for you), but I still like to suffer on the road bike up the local hill climbs. But, with age comes a wealth of experience. We’ve seen everything that could happen to your small, but growing business. \n\nOur clients tend to be:\n? Running a manufacturing, engineering or haulage company\n? Between £100k - £2.5m in turnover with staff members\n? Focused, hard-working with good Northern values\n? Open to new technology and new ways of working\n? Want someone to give them peace of mind that the financial stuff is secure and everything is being filed at the right time\n? Working with a stable or growing customer base\n? Primarily, but not always based in the north west\n\nIf you would like to experience a different kind of accountancy service tailored to your needs, then call us on 01706 368936 or email me at: paul@psaccountant.co.uk\n",

I maintain the currency of my qualification through continuous professional development and supported the Association as a member of the steering panel for the Southern Regional Members Network  from 2009 to 2019.\n\nMy career has been in management accounting and transaction management in the property management, computing, local authority, university education and maritime sectors. I have been a school governor and involved with a number of local charities. \n\nI started my own practice in 2009 and it is registered with the ACCA. I have found the responsibility of owning and running my own business challenging, scary at times but also very exciting and rewarding.  This experience is reflected in the advice and support I offer my clients because many of the challenges and issues they have to deal with are the same as those I face or have faced in my own business.  This enables me to understand their perspective much more fully than I would have done before becoming a business owner. \n\nI offer a fully rounded service to support business owners in all aspects of the financial affairs of their business throughout its lifecycle from start up and early growth through to eventual sale. I try to bring a human touch with my professional knowledge and experience, minimising use of the jargon of accounting wherever possible and talking with my clients in plain English, which they tend to appreciate more. I aim to be a business advisor and partner for my clients as well as a good accountant. \n\nWe are fully MTD compliant and keen to help with this challenge and the many others which business owners face in their journey to grow and develop their businesses. \n\nRecently we have adopted Receipt Bank for capturing business documents, storing them and passing data through into Quickbooks.

To be able to use my knowledge where it can have the biggest impact was the number 1 reason I left the corporate world”.\n\n“That’s the mission for my Company; to provide a first-class accounting service but at the same time to transfer the knowledge we have to our clients so that they are better equipped to successfully manage their businesses.”\n\n“10years on I’m glad to say we’ve have a number of fantastic success stories where our clients have implemented our advice to great effect. We even have a few that thankfully are still in business because they got the right advice at the right time”.",

          "summary": "I left school at 16 to become a trainee accountant at a Chartered Accountants in Blackpool. This was a long time ago now, before computers, everything was done manually and had to balance to the penny and Balance Sheets were still horizontal.  As frustratingly strict as this was, it was amazing grounding on discipline and fundamental concepts of accounting. Years later I have spent much time working in industry and enjoyed the diversity of consulting. There are not many industries I haven't come across.  I try to use my experience to help smaller business's and start-ups make the most of their opportunity's and encourage my clients to understand the importance of financial information and how it can help you establish and grow a successful business.\n\nI have spent several years working for charities and now use this expertise as an Independent Charity Examiner. I offer support to charity start ups and offer many free services to charities where ever I can. \n\nMy practice has a small office in Todmorden and is open most days and evenings, many of my clients don't have time to deal with their accounts in the daytime so evening meetings and calls are essential to keep up to date with things.\n\nI offer several accounting packages but prefer to advise on using quickbooks as the flexibility and customer support is excellent. I also find other packages seem that seem cheaper at the outset have many essential add-ons which you don't find out about till later, this is a pricing policy that I do not like to support.\n\nI offer fixed price services so my clients can plan and don't get unexpected bills at the end of the year.\n\nIf you need help and would like to chat about your situation please give me a call for some free advice. I guarantee I will do my best to help you, if I can't I will find someone that can. I have links with pensions advisors and complex tax advisors. I always offer a friendly service - no pin stripe suits in my office and children and dogs are very welcome.",

If so, then read on…\n\nWe don’t do jargon, we are the accountants that will tell you exactly how your business is performing.  We used to call ourselves the problem-solving accountants, but this sounded a little like we’d spent too much time drinking lattes with a marketing agency. That’s not us. \n\nWe won't judge you on the state of your business, but we have 4 key commitments to all our clients working with us:\nWe will get you back in control of your finances within 3 months\nWe will eradicate almost all of your paper receipts and invoices (never miss claiming some VAT again.)\nYou’ll always know if you can afford to bring on new people, machinery or premises (and we’ll help to create a plan to make it happen at the right time.)\nWe’ll turn around your work promptly, and always let you know when we plan to complete it. (One of our core values is ‘get stuff done’.)\n\nI may now be a little soft in my early 40s (that’s becoming a family man for you), but I still like to suffer on the road bike up the local hill climbs. But, with age comes a wealth of experience. We’ve seen everything that could happen to your small, but growing business. \n\nOur clients tend to be:\n? Running a manufacturing, engineering or haulage company\n? Between £100k - £2.5m in turnover with staff members\n? Focused, hard-working with good Northern values\n? Open to new technology and new ways of working\n? Want someone to give them peace of mind that the financial stuff is secure and everything is being filed at the right time\n? Working with a stable or growing customer base\n? Primarily, but not always based in the north west\n\nIf you would like to experience a different kind of accountancy service tailored to your needs, then call us on 01706 368936 or email me at: paul@psaccountant.co.uk\n",
